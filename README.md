<h3>Pizza Menu</h3>
<p>In this project, I created a example of a menu for a pizza place. I used JavaScript functions to have the inputs create an array based on the customer's order, and then calculate the total price based on the selected items.</p>

<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
<p>In this project, I created a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe to play with the computer. I used JavaScript functions to control the computer's movement, track win conditions, and output sound based on the actions taken in game. </p>

<h3>Calculator</h3>
<p>In this project, I created a basic 4-function calculator. I used JavaScript functions to perform operations, keep track of the decimal numbers, and provide output to the user.</p>

<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<p>In this project, I created a basic To-Do list to keep track of things to do. I used JSON parse and stringify methods to accept input and adjust the array of items accordingly.</p>
